# QuantumComputingFun
just some physic stuff in java


I like to develop quantum physic formula's in java just for the fun of the challenge, i think i cover more stuff i the future. 
I'm a mobile developer student so please fell free to have your opinion on my work! I need c&c for improve myself.
Wondering how a formula would be in code, feel free to ask in PM i will reply. 

Thanks for the reading,
Simone
